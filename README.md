# Automating-Philanthropy
We build tools to semi-automate a certain type of philanthropy.  The journey is at its first steps, and this repository first contains Excel VBA code to score IRS Form 990s.  The scoring ranks the forms based on the extent to which the 501c3 that submitted the 990 has an endowment, awards scholarships, and focuses on science education or research.
